I am Hongjie Wang (王泓杰), a third-year Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University, supervised by [Prof. Niraj K. Jha](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=R-z1R84AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). Before that, I received my B.S. degree with honor from Peking University (June 2021). I worked with [Prof. Yingyan Lin](https://eiclab.scs.gatech.edu/pages/team.html) and [Prof. Priyanka Raina](https://priyanka-raina.github.io/) as a research intern at Rice University and Stanford University, respectively.
