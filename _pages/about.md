I am Hongjie Wang (王泓杰), a forth-year Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University, supervised by Prof. [Niraj K. Jha](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=R-z1R84AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). Before that, I received my *B.S. degree with honor* from Peking University (June 2021). You can find more information in my [CV](https://hongjiew.github.io/files/resume.pdf). 

My research focuses on the efficiency of Machine Learning models, including but not limited to: (1) Vision Transformers, (2) Diffusion Models, (3) Vision-Language Models (Multimodal Generative Models), and (4) State Space Models. My research aims to make their training and inference more efficient and thus enable scaling them up for generation with higher quality. My recent projects focus on the hardware-agnostic efficiency enhancement of them, but I am also interested in the software-hardware co-design to boost their throughputs.

Please feel free to reach out via hongjiewang@princeton.edu if you share interests similar to mine! I am glad to chat and explore opportunities for collaboration.

## Publications and Preprints

- **LinGen: Towards High-Resolution Minute-Length Text-to-Video Generation with Linear Computational Complexity**

  **Hongjie Wang**, Chih-Yao Ma, Yen-Cheng Liu, Ji Hou, Tao Xu, Jialiang Wang, Felix Juefei-Xu, Yaqiao Luo, Peizhao Zhang, Tingbo Hou, Peter Vajda, Niraj K. Jha, Xiaoliang Dai

  ArXiv preprint [[paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09856)] [[project](https://lineargen.github.io/)]

  ![LinGen](https://lineargen.github.io/static/images/overview.png)

  **Highlight:** For the first time, we demonstrate **high-resolution 68-second video generation at 16fps on a single GPU** — without relying on autoregressive extensions, super-resolution, or frame interpolation. Our approach achieves **linear computational complexity**, offering **up to 15x speed-up** over the standard DiT architecture, while delivering **improved video quality and better text alignment**. We believe this linear complexity provides extraordinary scalability, paving the way to hour-length movie generation. 

- **AT-EDM: Attention-Driven Training-Free Efficiency Enhancement of Diffusion Models**

  **Hongjie Wang**, Difan Liu, Yan Kang, Yijun Li, Zhe Lin, Niraj K. Jha, Yuchen Liu

  *IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) 2024* [[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05252)] [[project](https://atedm.github.io/)]

  ![AT-EDM](https://hongjiew.github.io/files/ATEDM.png)

  **Highlight:** We introduce the Attention-driven Training-free Efficient Diffusion Model (**AT-EDM**), a framework that leverages attention maps to perform run-time pruning of redundant tokens during inference **without fine-tuning** **or** performing GPU-intensive **optimization** on a certain loss function. AT-EDM reduces the FLOPs of the state-of-the-art open-source diffusion model, [SD-XL](https://github.com/Stability-AI/generative-models), by **40%** while keeping its FID and CLIP scores. 

- **Zero-TPrune: Zero-Shot Token Pruning through Leveraging of the Attention Graph in Pre-Trained Transformers**

  **Hongjie Wang**, Bhishma Dedhia, Niraj K. Jha

  *IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) 2024* [[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17328)] [[project](https://zerotprune.github.io/)]

  ![Zero-TPrune](https://hongjiew.github.io/files/zero-tprune.png)

  **Highlight:** We propose Zero-TPrune, the first zero-shot method that considers both the importance and similarity of tokens in performing token pruning. It leverages the attention graph of pre-trained Transformer models to produce an importance distribution for tokens via our proposed Weighted Page Rank (WPR) algorithm. It can be deployed on large Vision Transformers at negligible computational cost. Without any fine-tuning, Zero-TPrune reduces the FLOPs cost of DeiT-S by 34.7% and improves its throughput by 45.3% with only 0.4% accuracy loss.
